# Welcome to my University Portfolio

If you are an employment agent, thank you for considering my application. 

This a collection of all my university work I have completed over the years. Each folder across the years contains the most important and significant pieces of work I have completed to obtain the grades I have gotten.

My current and personal favourite is my final year 1 project, a rather large scale, complex project consisting of many elements that has helped development my understanding of core code building principles, including using version control software and bash scripting, while also delving into very low level concepts such as bit twiddling and its role in the creation of compression algorithms.
