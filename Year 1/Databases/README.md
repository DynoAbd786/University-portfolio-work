# Databases

Welcome to my databases project

This piece of coursework involved executing queires on a database to produce views for an autograder to mark. The queries were based on the chinook database (chinook.db) where I had to follow the brief to produce the correct outcomes and answers. There were 5 queries I created, each displayed in its own view.

This project was worth 30% of the whole module. In this project, I had achieved 90%. Some areas of lost marks included a slight mispelling of the column of a table and a missing section of data for Q3.
