# Welcome to OOP

Here you will find the coursework submissions for my java based programs. These programs were primarily coded in Windows as was tested to work for the Red Hat 8 OS. For each project, there is an associated gradle that can be run to execute some unit tests, which served as the basis for the final submission.

Do take note, Coursework 2 does not have any content inside as the assignment was based on developing a simple gambling game. I was not comfortable uploading this since it went agaisnt my personal beliefs.
