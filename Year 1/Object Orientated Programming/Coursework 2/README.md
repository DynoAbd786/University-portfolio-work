# Welcome to OOP Coursework 2

This coursework was about developing the game Baccarat, where classes for card and deck where provided. The objective here was to use inheritance and compostion to develop the baccarat game.

This project scored well at submission, scoring 90%. Areas where I lost marks where primarily due to the lack of knowlegde playing the game, where a rule was missed out 

As you can see, there are no files associated for this submission. Due to my personal beliefs, I did not feel comfortable uploading a variation of gambling to my university repositiory.
