# Welcome to OOP Coursework 1

I am currently in the process of obtaining information for this piece of coursework, and will update this README as soon as the information is available to me

The source code for this project can be found in src/main, and tests can be found in src/test folder. TO execute the gradle terminal, consult the "Using Gradle.md" file. The code for ~ runPlot ~ and ~ run was completed to achieve 100% completion. ~convertToKML~ was left out.

This project was useful to help me understand and develop my core OOP skills, including developing getter and setter methods to fulfil the tests set by a provided gradle. This project also provided me with exposure to gradle, which I have found to be a popular toolkit for java developers. Because of the advanced task, this project has also taught me how to run very simple java applications and programs.

The overall score for this submission was 100%
